*ServerTest is the android code for the project(used android studio) 
*countArea.m is the matlab code(algorithm) to calculate the area of the leaf (used matlab 2014 b).Matlab code should be in the server.
*upload.php is the php file.That file should be saved in the server

Note:These codes are written by considering the xampp(Apache) as the server.
In order to  implement in another server,relavant changes should be done to the codes and relavent folders should be created.
